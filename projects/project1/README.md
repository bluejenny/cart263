++++ We Live +++++

Is capitalism the root of all evil or are we just making the wrong choices. Are our options so black and white. Is it really this simple to change the world?

Based on the film 'They Live', a 1988 science-fiction action horror film written and directed by John Carpenter, based on the 1963 short story "Eight O'Clock in the Morning" by Ray Nelson. The film follows an unnamed drifter who discovers through special sunglasses that the ruling class are aliens concealing their appearance and manipulating people to consume, breed, and conform to the status quo via subliminal messages in mass media.
