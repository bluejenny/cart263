Over time a chronological series of blocks creates a colourful tapestry of introspection. Similar to a calendar in structure but where the passing of time is irrelevant, the user is asked to reflect on a specific moment by way of color and feeling. This simplified form functions as a tool to collect data from the user which when submitted is timestamped and placed in the correct order on the page. These nondescript blocks are based on a series of user inputs including color, width and alignment. The result is a deliberately simplified display of changing emotions over a period of time.

Although a reflection over time, there are no boundaries on the passing of time. The form can be submited daily, weekly or by the second. The data will always appear chronological but does not directly translate into a direct timeline. The user ultimately has full control over time as well as the interface.

Everything on the page is controlled by the user. The forms and buttons are draggable so the user can move them around or off screen. The instructions can be turned off. The user is also able to erase the data collected at any point and start over.

The passing of time measured by changing of moods creates a very different timeline for each user. Ultimately this information would be stored in a database but for the purpose of this project I have used localStorage. I do not know how may blocks I will be capable of storing as I am currently testing this out. I have read up to 5mb of data per url but may differ between browsers.
