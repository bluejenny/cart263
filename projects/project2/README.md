A journal to record your moods.

Over a self determined timeframe this chronological series of blocks creates a colourful tapestry of introspection. Similar to a calendar in structure but where the passing of time is blurred by the inputs. The user is instructed to reflect on a specific moment by way of color and feeling. The simplified user-input form functions as the tool to collect info which when submitted is timestamped and placed in the correct order on the page and stored for future reference. These nondescript blocks are based on a series of user inputs including color, width and alignment. The result is a purposely simplified display of changing emotions.

Memories can be distorted and not always accurate. The past is often blurred into blocks of time not specific to date and time. This calendar as a whole allows us to connect to our past self without the need to remember the details but rather to reflect on the range of human emotions over a given time.

Although a reflection over time, there are no boundaries on time. Currently the page is set up per week, 7 columns across the page with no end and no beginning. Ideally and if time allowed this would also be controlled by user input for the number of columns / rows on the page. The form can be submitted daily, weekly, by the second or even for moments in the past. The data will always appear chronological but does not directly translate into a direct timeframe. The user ultimately has full control over time as well as the interface.

Everything on the page is controlled by the user. The forms and buttons are draggable so the user can move them around or off screen. The instructions can be turned on and off as needed. The user is also able to erase the data collected at any point and start over.

The calendar over time creates a very personal timeline and visual for each user. Ultimately this information would be stored in a database but for the purpose of this project I have used localStorage.
