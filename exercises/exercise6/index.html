      <p>
        A memoâ€™s purpose is often to inform, but it occasionally includes an
        element of persuasion or a
        <span class="top-secret redacted">call to action</span>. All
        organizations have informal and formal communication networks. The
        unofficial, informal communication network within an organization is
        often called
        <span class="top-secret redacted">the grapevine</span> while the
        <span class="top-secret redacted">official communication</span> is
        called a memorandum or memo.
      </p>
      <p>
        A memo has a header that clearly indicates who sent it and who the
        intended recipients are.
        <span class="top-secret redacted">Pay particular attention</span> to the
        title of the individual(s) in this section. Date and subject lines are
        also present, followed by a message that <span class="top-secret redacted">contains
        a declaration</span>, a discussion,
        and a summary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Memos are often announcements, and the person sending the memo <span class="top-secret redacted">speaks
        for a part or all</span> of the organization. While
        it may contain a request for feedback, the announcement itself is
        linear, from the
        organization to the
        <span class="top-secret redacted">employees</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some written business communication
        <span class="top-secret redacted">allows for a choice</span> between
        direct and indirect formats, but memorandums are
        <span class="top-secret redacted">always direct</span>. <span class="top-secret redacted">The purpose is
        clearly announced</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Memos are a
        <span class="top-secret redacted">place for just the facts</span>, and
        should have an objective tone without <span class="top-secret redacted">personal bias</span>, preference, or
        interest on display.
        <span class="top-secret redacted">Avoid</span> subjectivity.
